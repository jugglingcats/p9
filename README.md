# Espruino/ESP32 Christmas Greetings

Scrolling text on 128x64 OLED SSH1106 display.

This project is designed to run on on an ESP32 microcontroller coupled with an OLED display connected over I2C, specifically this board: https://www.banggood.com/Wemos-ESP-WROOM-32-Rev1-ESP32-OLED-Board-4-Mt-Bytes32-Mt-bit-Flash-And-Wi-Fi-Antennas-p-1214791.html.

The board has been flashed with the Espruino firmware as described here: http://www.espruino.com/ESP32.

Espruino (https://www.espruino.com) is a project that allows you to write code on a microcontroller using Javascript. They provide a simple browser-based IDE that allows you to upload Javascript to the board: https://www.espruino.com/Web+IDE.

You can also write code in C/C++ using the Espressif tools (makers of the ESP32), if you want to get more low-level: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest.

There is even an Arduino compatible firmware for the ESP32: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32.

The ESP32 is much more capable (and cheaper) than the Arduino.
